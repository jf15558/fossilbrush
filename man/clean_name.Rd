\usage{
clean_name(x, terms = NULL, collapse = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of names to clean. This will be coerced to
class character internally}

\item{terms}{a character vector of terms to remove from
elements of x. Terms are only removed as whole words, rather
than if they also happen to occur as strings within elements
of x}

\item{collapse}{a character vector of strings which should
collapsed (i.e. replaced by "", rather than the default " ").
If one of the collapse terms is a special regex character, it
will need to be escaped, e.g. "\\-"}

\item{verbose}{A logical of length 1 determining if function
progress should be reported to the console}
}
\value{
a character vector the same length as x. Elements
which were reduced to zero characters during cleaning are
returned as NA
}
\description{
clean_name
}
\details{
Function which bundles a series of cleaning routines into a
single process. First any words in brackets are removed,
followed by a series of user-defined terms if given. Next
Roman and Arabic numerical are removed, then abbreviations
up to five letters (abbreviations are matched by the
following dot e.g ABFS.). By default, characters for removal
are replaced by a white space to prevent accidental collapse
of strings. However, there may be specific cases where a
collapse is required and so terms given in collapse are
dealt with next. After collapsing, rogue all rogue punctation
is removed, then isolated lowercase letters, then isolated
groups of capitals up to 5 characters long. Finally, white
spaces greater than 1 are removed, along with trailing white
space, any remaining strings longer than 2 words subsetted
to the first word, the first letter of each string capitalised
and zero length strings converted to NA
