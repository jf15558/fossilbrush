\description{
Convenience function to add in a kingdom column to a PBDB
dataset. This relies on the dataset having a column of
phylum-level assignments for occurrences. The kingdom
column is a useful addition for filtering very large
taxonomically diverse datasets, and adds in an additional
level of data which can inform taxonomic cleaning routines
like those called by @seealso check_taxonomy
