  x,
  terms = NULL,
  groups = NULL,
  jw = 0.1,
  str = 1,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a dataframe containing a column with terms, and a
further column denoting the groups within which terms will
be checked against one another. If supplying a dataframe with
just these columns, terms should be column 1}

\item{terms}{a character vector of length 1, specifying the
terms column in x. This is required if x contains more than
two columns. Alternatively, if x is not provided, terms can
be a character vector. If groups are not specified, all
elements of terms will be treated as part of the same group}

\item{groups}{a character vector of length 1, specifying the
groups column in x. This is required if x contains more than
two columns. Alternatively, if terms is supplied as a
character vector, groups can also be supplied in the same way
to denote their groups}

\item{jw}{a numeric greater than 0 and less than 1. This is
the distance threshold below which potential synonyms will be
considered}

\item{str}{A positive integer specifying the
number of matching characters at the beginning of synonym
pairs. By default 1, i.e. the first letters must match}

\item{str2}{If not NULL, a positive integer specifying the
number of matching characters at the end of synonym pairs}

\item{alternative}{A character string of length one corresponding
to one of the methods used by @seealso afind. One of "osa",
"lv", "dl", "hamming", "lcs", "qgram", "cosine",
"running_cosine", "jaccard", or "soundex".}

\item{q}{q-gram size. Only used when alternative is "qgram",
"cosine" or "Jaccard".}

\item{pref}{If not NULL, a character vector of prefixes which
may result in erroneously low JW distances. Synonyms will only
be considered if both terms share the same prefix}

\item{suff}{If not NULL, a character vector of suffices which
may result in erroneously low JW distances. Synonyms will only
be considered if both terms share the same suffix}

\item{exclude}{If not NULL, a character vector of group names
which should be skipped - useful for groups which are known
to contain potentially similar terms}

\item{verbose}{A logical determining if function progress be reported using the
pbapply progress bar}
}
\value{
a dataframe of synonyms (cols 1 and 2), the group in
which they occur, the frequencies of each synonym in the dataset
and finally the q-gram difference between the synonyms
}
\description{
Function for checking for potential synonyms with alternate
spellings. Synonyms are checked for within group using using
a Jaro Winkler string distance matrix. Potential synonyms are
selected using the jw threshold. These can then be further
filtered by the number of shared letters at the beginning and
end of the a synonym pair, and by prefixes or suffixes which
may give erroneously high similarities.
