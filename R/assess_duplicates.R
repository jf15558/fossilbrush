#' assess_duplicates
#'
#' Function to assess and resolve elements with multiple higher
#' classifications in a tgraph object. Assessment is performed
#' based on the topology of the graph they form. Linear paths
#' (i.e. two totally separate paths diverging from the a shared
#' node), rings (divergent paths which only reunite at the
#' highest rank in the tgraph) or more than two divergent paths
#' are treated as distinct. If not any of these cases, the
#' distance between the focal element and the reunion of the
#' divergent paths, along with their subtopologies are assessed
#' and a consensus or preferred path based on the frequency of
#' each path in the tgraph or their completeness returned, or
#' the element judged as having multiple distinct
#' classifications
#' @param x A tgraph object
#' @param node character vector of elements with multiple higher
#' classifications in x, or a tvertseq object with those same
#' elements as focal
#' @param mode The rule to be used in selecting between multiple
#' higher classifications. It is possible for the most complete
#' pathway to also be the most frequent
#' @param jump The maximum number of levels between the point of
#' divergence and the point of reunion (if present) for a given
#' path, below which the divergence will be taken as conflicting
#' @param plot A logical speciying if the divergent paths should
#' be plotted
#' @return A list with as many items as elements with multiple
#' classifications, each recording the assessment for a given
#' element
